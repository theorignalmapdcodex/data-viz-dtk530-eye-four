# Visualizations Project

This project demonstrates various data visualization techniques using Python. The notebook includes examples of static and interactive plots for data analysis.

## Project Structure

- **DTK530_I_4_Visualizations_MichaelA_P.ipynb**: The Jupyter Notebook containing code and outputs for data visualizations.

## Installation

To run this project locally, ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required packages by running the following commands:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly


# Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.

2. Open the notebook using Jupyter or JupyterLab:
```bash
jupyter notebook DTK530_I_4_Visualizations_MichaelA_P.ipynb
```

3. Run each cell to see the visualizations. Each section demonstrates a different data visualization technique.

# Visualizations

This project includes examples of the following types of visualizations:

* Bar Charts: Used for comparing discrete data values across categories.

* Line Plots: Ideal for showing trends over time or continuous data relationships.

* Scatter Plots: Visualizes the relationship between two variables, often used to identify correlations.

* Interactive Plots: Created using Plotly to add interactivity, enabling hover effects, zooming, and more.

Each visualization demonstrates how to handle and represent data using various Python libraries, making it easy to explore data patterns and insights.
